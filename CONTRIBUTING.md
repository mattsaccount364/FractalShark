# Code of Conduct

## TL;DR

Be reasonable. Don’t be a jerk. If this ever becomes a real community, I’ll write a real code of conduct.

## The Current Situation

At present, this project has exactly **one** active human contributor.

As a result, all discussions, disagreements, and conflicts are handled through the highly advanced conflict-resolution mechanism known as:

> *me thinking about it for a bit*

This system has a 100% success rate so far.

## Expectations

If you somehow find yourself interacting with this repository:

- Be civil
- Assume good intent
- Keep discussions technical and constructive
- Remember that text has no tone, but sarcasm definitely does

If you violate these expectations, the likely outcome is that I will:
- Ignore it
- Fix it
- Or quietly roll my eyes while fixing it

Possibly in that order.

## Future Contributors

If at some point:
- Someone opens a serious pull request  
- Multiple humans are involved  
- Or this project escapes my hard drive and gains actual users  

…then congratulations 🎉  
This file will be replaced with a proper Code of Conduct, probably based on a standard template, with real rules, reporting procedures, and all the grown-up stuff.

Until then, this document exists mainly so that:
- GitHub stops nagging me
- And everyone can have a small chuckle

---

## Enforcement

Current enforcement mechanism:

```text
if (being_a_jerk) {
    don’t();
}
