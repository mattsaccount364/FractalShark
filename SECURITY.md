# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the current `main` branch is supported.  
Everything else is for historical interest.

---

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security issue, please report it privately to the repository owner.

Include:
- What the issue is
- How to reproduce it
- Why it matters (if it does)

Please don’t open a public issue until it’s fixed.

---

## Response

There is no security team.  
There is one person who reads messages and fixes bugs.

Response time is “as soon as practical,” where *practical* is defined loosely.

---

## Scope

This is experimental software.

If you deploy it in production, critical infrastructure, or anything involving safety, that’s on you (and possibly your risk assessment team).

---

## Disclosure

Responsible disclosure is appreciated.  
Irresponsible disclosure will still result in the bug being fixed, just with less enthusiasm.

---

## Rewards

There is no bug bounty.

You will, however, receive genuine thanks and possibly a knowing nod.
